Download the github repo by doing `git clone https://github.com/THZoria/NX_Bot.git` (Requires git to be installed on your device) Or maybe clicked code button `download ZIP`

This bot requires Node JS version 16 and a good machine with at least 8GB of RAM
You must install the node js modules by doing `"npm install -i"`.

Added the discord token in the `.env`

- NXBot now uses the slash control system imposed by discord to use the new API, for the used and search for a game you have to do `/nxbrew game name`.
- You can also search for 3DS games with the command `/ghosteshop game name`.
Also added the command `/cdn ame name`.

This command uses a json file that you have to host yourself, you can base it on the [template.json](https://github.com/THZoria/NX_Bot/blob/main/template.json) file and edited line 11 of the [cdn command](https://github.com/THZoria/NX_Bot/blob/main/commands/warez/CDN.js#L11)
